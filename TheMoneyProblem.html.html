		 The money problem is when you're lacking the required resources to be able to make the choices that would allow for a unique and desirable path through life. Instead finding yourself following a well trodden path of financial scarcity, forced to devote a lifetime of attention and energy to the task of survival and bill paying.
<br><br>
		    Excess income used to be able to sit in the bank and generate interest. Now it doesn’t really do that, instead the interest generated by your money doesn’t cover your loss of purchasing power from inflation and it's taxed. These poor returns create an incentive not to save, but don't think of money in the bank as an income generating investment.
<br><br>
		    Interestingly, the interest rates for investment loans tend to be around 2% currently. This creates an incentive to invest money you haven't earned yet. Your money in the bank can be used as collateral to borrow more money for investing, that's its true purpose.
<br><br>
		    If you save 5-20% the value of a property, you can use that deposit to buy a house. Once you have a house, your $50k in cash is now a $500k investment in the real estate market. Unlike money in the bank, houses do tend to keep up with inflation. 
<br><br>
		    Plus, you can buy income generating investments. A good investment will generate enough income to pay its' own loan while appreciating in value. Buy something for 200k, it pays for itself, sell for 300k. Rinse and repeat.
<br><br>
		    Let's talk more specifically about strategies for investing your excess income to attain the necessary wealth to fund a meaningful life. These are not foolproof, but in general they have a higher chance of success than most other strategies. The value of $1,000,000.00 has been selected arbitrarily to demonstrate the potential of these strategies.
<br><br>
		    These strategies tend to work best if you’ve gained the type of stability discussed in episode 2. 
   <br><br>

	    	<div class = "strategy">
	
<strong>STRATEGY 1: Entrepreneurship</strong><br>
This strategy is ideal for high-confidence, high-energy, highly adaptable people. <br><br>
1. Attain a diploma, trade or degree* in a field of personal interest**. <br>
2. Gain employment in the field and focus on developing competence. <br>
3. Use your reputation to begin working for yourself once you are capable.*** <br>
4. Once you have more work than you can handle on your own, hire and train competent employees. <br> 
5. Keep the business alive by ensuring work remains to a high standard. <br>
6. Once the net-profit of the business reaches $250,000.00, you should be able to sell the business for $1,000,000.00**** 
<br><br>	</div>
*Unless you don’t want to <br>
**Without personal interest you will likely be outcompeted. <br>
***Use <a href="https://aaronunify.github.io/Contracts_test_3/Contractor_Agreement">the contractor agreement</a> to make this step easier. <br>
****Businesses tend to sell for a multiple of their earnings. Depending on the economy and industry prices vary. As a conservative estimate I use x4 net profit. 
<br><br>

		
<div class = "strategy">

<strong>STRATEGY 2: Property</strong><br>
This is the strategy I have chosen for the time being. 
It is easier to run this strategy if you are in a relationship as two people tend to earn more than one. 
<br><br>
1. Attain employment, excess income and save 10%* of the properties value**. <br>
2. Visit the bank or mortgage broker and tell them you are interested in purchasing a property***. <br> 
3. Purchase your first property and being building equity****. <br>
4. Use the equity from the first property to purchase a second, then third property. <br> 
5. Rent out your two properties while living in the third. Wait 10-20 years for them to increase 2x, or 3x, in value. <br>
6. Once the properties have significantly increased in value, sell one to pay down your debt. In total the remaining two are likely worth $1,000,000+.  

		
	<br><br>		</div>
	

	
	
*This is dependent on the lending laws of your area. <br>
**Pick a cheap one first, rising property prices make it difficult to save 10% because the goalposts keep moving. <br>
***If they say no, go to a different bank or mortgage broker. <br>
****Equity is generated when the property price increases after the time of purchase, and when you pay down your mortgage. <br>

	
	<br><br>

	
	
		<div class = "strategy">
<strong>STRATEGY 3: Stocks</strong><br>
Stocks are great for people who are willing to trade volatility in their net worth for flexibility. 
Stocks can be bought and sold at any time* and tend to trend upwards over time. 
Index funds are a suitable alternative to stocks for people who want to do minimum research while gaining access to the returns of the stock market. 
<br><br>
1. Attain employment and excess income. <br>
2. Use excess income to purchase stocks or index funds<br>
3. Reinvest the income generated by your stocks into more stocks. <br>
4. If you can manage a 8% return, $1,666.66 invested monthly for 20 years compounds into $1,000,000.00<br>

*Provided the market is open
			
			<br><br></div>
	
	<br><br>
Stocks are great because of the flexibility they offer. 
Miss a month of savings?? No worries, it'll just take longer to reach your financial goals. 
Have some extra income? Great, invest it if you like.  Although, I would warn against trying to time the market in general, there are times when the stock market crashes and everything is cheap. 
<br><br>

<div class = "strategy">
<strong>STRATEGY 4: Seller Finance an existing business</strong><br>
<br><br>
Seller finance allows you to purchase 100% of a business but only pay 60% of the purchase price upfront. The remaining 40% is paid over the following few years. To do this you are required to provide a deposit of 10% of the purchase price of the business in cash or home equity to the bank for a business loan. 
<br><br>
Remember to buy as close to 4x earnings as possible. A business generating $125,000.00 in profit should be worth around $500,000.00. If the business is currently unprofitable, you should probably pass up the deal. If the seller is unwilling to do the deal through seller finance, it may be the case that they don’t think the business will still be generating money in a few years time, in which case you should probably pass up the deal. It may also be the case that the seller is simply being offered a better deal from someone else. 
<br><br>
Now the good thing about Seller Finance is that you purchase a business that is already generating a profit but you don’t pay the full price upfront. If the business is worth $500,000.00 and you pay 60% upfront, you’re still left with 200k in cash. This money can be used to improve and update the business. 
<br><br>
There are two things to spend this money on, purchasing/leasing equipment and hiring talent. Ideally you’ll purchase a business in which you can operate as an employee, which hasn’t been marketed well. In the age of the internet you should be able to market your business for free, so don’t pay for this, unless you intend to use the hours saved for more profitable activity. 
<br><br>
Remember that businesses sell for multiples of earnings. If you increase the earnings of the business from $125,000.00 to $250,000.00 you’ve roughly doubled the value of the business. $500,000.00 to $1,000,000.00. 
<br><br>
A word of warning though, when this strategy goes wrong, it goes really wrong. You’ll probably go bankrupt and damage your reputation. So don’t rush into this kind thing.  
<br><br>
1. Generate a 10% deposit of the purchase price of a profitable business that operates within the abilities of your skillset.*  <br>
2. Negotiate to purchase through seller finance. <br>
3. Market the business, use your remaining money to hire talent and upgrade equipment, work really hard. <br>
4. Sell the business when you’re ready to do something else. <br>

			
			<br><br></div>

<p>
<br><br>
You may have noticed that these strategies are not exclusive. It is possible to run them all at the same time, however your income, time and energy will be major bottlenecks slowing your progress. It is likely best to run one strategy at a time, until you are confident that your finances are secure and that you have the time and energy required to begin an additional strategy.
<br><br>
It is important to be intentional with your finances, because in doing so, you will have the best chance of obtaining the necessary resources to fund the life you want.  </p>
